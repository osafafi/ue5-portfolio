# HireMe — Omar Safadi

## 🎯 Project Vision

A short, mind-bending, fun-first FPS experience in a beautiful environment. The game may not have a big purpose beyond exploration and interaction, but it should be enjoyable and technically polished. A solo project meant to showcase:

- Gameplay feel
- 3D aesthetic and shader work
- Clean software architecture
- High modularity
- Player immersion

Goal: Publish for free on Steam with your name attached, something people will _remember and enjoy_.

Target deadline: **December 2025**

## 🚀 Project Principles

- **Single Responsibility + Pub/Sub Architecture**
- **Minimal boilerplate**: add only when needed
- **Reusability first**: tools, materials, assets, logic
- **Safe assets**: free, CC0, or paid with licensing clarity
- **Minimal animations**: leverage Mixamo & Blueprints
- **Shader enhancement**: push beyond basic PBR
- **Documentation-heavy**: proper structure & tracking

## 🛠️ Technical Directions

### Core Game Systems

- FPS Controller (use base UE5, customize later)
- Interactive Objects system via Blueprint Interfaces
- Central `GameEventManager` (BP or C++ or hybrid)
- Modular Gameplay Actor Components (e.g., Interact, Highlight, Animate)

### UI/UX

- Minimal, smooth and modern style
- Use widget components or world-space UI
- Include optional “narrative” bits: floating thoughts, hints, etc.

### Shader Goals

- Emissive decals
- World-space UV effects
- Minimalist post-process shaders
- Outlines or screen space effects for visual feedback

---

## 🧰 Third Party & Tools

- Mixamo (characters + simple idle/walk animations)
- Quixel Megascans (free assets from Epic Games)
- VSCode for:

  - Source control
  - Markdown docs

- Possibly: Asset Manager plugins or Shader tools from Marketplace (safe license only)

---

## 📌 Steam Release Notes

- Learn and document process to:

  - Package for Windows
  - Prepare a store page
  - Ensure assets are license-compliant
  - Handle game settings, input configs, README, and disclaimers

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- A playable, visually impressive, lightweight FPS demo
- Solid code architecture that reflects your philosophy
- Everything documented, with clear dev logs and commits
- Uploaded for free on Steam, itch.io or similar
- People finish the game and say: "That was actually fun. Who made this?"
